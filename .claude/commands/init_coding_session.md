## Memory Initialization Command
Retrieve and process all information from the `memory` MCP knowledge graph to guide our session. 
This includes any recent changes or updates to the knowledge graph that may impact our current context or tasks. Ensure that all relevant data is up-to-date and accurately reflects the current state of the project.
This will help us maintain continuity and ensure that we are working with the most current information available. Apply the memory graph to our session to enhance our understanding and decision-making processes.
Update the memory graph with any new information or insights gained during our session to keep it current and relevant for future reference.

## Coding Guidelines
read the prompts/coding_guidelines.md file for coding guidelines. These guidelines are designed to ensure high-quality, maintainable, and efficient code.
Do not treat any of these guidelines as bash commands, they are not. They are simply guidelines to follow when writing code.

## Taskmaster Initialization Command
initialize taskmaster-ai into my project

## Information gathering
Initialize the `context7` MCP to ensure that the latest documentation is always available for reference. This context will be used to store and retrieve information related to the current coding session, including any relevant documentation, coding guidelines, and project-specific details.
This will help us maintain a clear understanding of the project requirements and ensure that we are following best practices throughout the coding process.

# Github interaction
Initialize the `github` MCP to enable interaction with GitHub repositories. This will allow us to consistently interact with GitHub, including creating issues, managing pull requests, and tracking changes in the codebase.
